# Email_Sender
Hi!</br>
I'm learning python language on Udem and my "teacher" in one of the lessons showed me how to send email on python.</br>
So I had think...why don't I try to create a python's class to send the emails easily? why not?🤷🏻‍♂️</br>
So...I did it, perhaps😅</br>
</br>
<h3>Take a look at the code and let me know what you think!😜</h3>

## How is it structured?🤔
It is formed by 4 files.</br>
The main program is named "send_mail.py" that contains into itself the definition of the class and of the methods.</br>
The other files are:
<ol>
  <li>"html_doc.html" => that contains the message in html that you want to send at your users</li>
  <li>"email.txt" => it should contains a list of the emails that you want to send the message</li>
  <li>"login.txt" => it contains the access data to your email's service like email and password</li>
</ol>

## How it works?🤨
