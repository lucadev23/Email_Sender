# Email_Sender
Hi!
I'm learning python language on Udem and my "teacher" in one of the lessons showed me how to send email on python.</br>
So I had think...why don't I try to create a python's class to send the emails easily? why not?</br>
So...I did it, perhaps</br>
</br>
<h3>Take a look at the code and let me know what you think!</h3>
<h5>Have Fun!</h5></br></br>
